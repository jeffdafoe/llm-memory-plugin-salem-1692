// golden_test.go — LLM-106 perception golden-payload scenario harness (proof of
// concept). Each scenario builds a deterministic Snapshot fixture for one
// situation the perception layer branches on, renders the WHOLE assembled prompt
// (durable + ephemeral — exactly what the model receives, via combinedPrompt),
// and pins it to a checked-in golden file under testdata/goldens/.
//
// The value is the DIFF: a cue change shows, per scenario, exactly how the prompt
// an NPC sees changed — surfacing a cue that leaks into (or vanishes from) a
// situation it shouldn't, which per-builder unit tests structurally can't see
// (they assert one builder's output, never the assembled prompt across the
// branching axes). After an INTENDED change, regenerate and review:
//
//	go test ./sim/perception -run TestPerceptionGoldens -update-goldens
//	git diff -- engine/sim/perception/testdata/goldens   # read every changed scenario
//
// Scope (POC): scenarios MUST be clock-free — no pending deliveries / owed orders.
// renderPendingDeliveries{From,To}Me read time.Now() for the per-order expiry
// clause (render.go), so an order-bearing scenario is not byte-stable yet.
// Injecting that render clock from the Payload is the prerequisite for bringing
// order scenarios into the matrix — tracked on LLM-106. The per-scenario
// determinism guard below trips loudly if a wall-clock read ever sneaks in.
