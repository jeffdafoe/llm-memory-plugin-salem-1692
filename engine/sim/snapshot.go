// perception build, and the checkpoint writer all consume. The world
// goroutine publishes a fresh Snapshot via World.published (atomic.Pointer)
// after every command, so readers atomic.Load and serialize without
// touching the world goroutine.
//
// The snapshot deliberately omits secondary indices, mutable handler state,
// and any field that consumers can recompute or don't need.
